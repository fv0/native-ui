### 0.13.0

- Perfected close buttons.
- Made the tabs and treeview have a lighter color, when the window is out of focus. Thanks to [leo](https://github.com/leo).
- Added subtle gradient to status bar like in Finder.
- Adjusted the Git status indicators for the tabs.

### 0.12.0

- Simplified the *modified* indicator and removed the color of it.
- Moved changelog to seperate file. Atom now recognizes this and shows it as a button in the theme.
- Added colored tab corners to show the Git status.
- Fixed [#29](https://github.com/fv0/native-ui/issues/29): No more overlapping of the scrollbar if you decide to have scrollbars visible all the time.
- Fixed [#30](https://github.com/fv0/native-ui/issues/30): When the files tree view is closed there is no more border to the left of the window.

#### 0.11.0

- Fixed [#27](https://github.com/fv0/native-ui/issues/27): You can know scroll and click in the modal windows again.
- Fixed [#23](https://github.com/fv0/native-ui/issues/23): For people who choose VCS coloring in the settings of the `tabs` package, this is a more better readible display and is optically identical to the sidebar solution. [#25](https://github.com/fv0/native-ui/issues/25) is related.
- Fixed [#22](https://github.com/fv0/native-ui/issues/22): No border bottom radius on popup window when there is no description.
